![Head Shot][]

I am Daniel Birket, a software engineer grown gray helping
[Glenn Birket][], [Steve Birket][] and [Birket Engineering][] to create
control systems for safety-related applications for theme-park
attractions and entertainment venues world-wide. If you have visited a
few popular theme-parks and rode their rides, there is an excellent
chance that one of our control systems helped to ensure your safety.

I, my wife and our three grown children live and work in central
Florida, USA, near the popular Disney World and Universal Studios theme
parks - at least when I'm not on assignment at a theme-park somewhere
else in the world. Twenty-five years ago, before I joined the world's
small community of theme-park engineers, I, like my father, worked in
central Florida's original preeminent industry: Aerospace. Today, if you
know where to look, you can still see the once-secluded
[Lockheed-Martin][] aerospace complex through the trees from one of the
many tourist attractions that grew up around it.
