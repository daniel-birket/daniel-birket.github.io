I am Daniel Birket, a software engineer who has grown gray helping
[Glenn
Birket](http://www.birket.com/2018/10/glenn-birket-receives-tea-masters-award/
"TEA Masters Award"), [Steve Birket](http://www.inparkmagazine.com/birket-tea-president-elect/ "TEA President") and 
[Birket Engineering](http://www.birket.com) to create control systems
for safety-related applications for theme-park attractions and
entertainment venues world-wide. If you have visited a few popular
theme-parks and rode their rides, there is an excellent chance that one
of our control systems helped to ensure your safety.

I, my wife and our three grown children live and work in central
Florida, USA, near the popular Disney World and Universal Studios
theme parks - at least when I’m not on assignment at a theme-park
somewhere else in the world. Twenty-five years ago, before I joined
the world’s small community of theme-park engineers, I, like my
father, worked in central Florida’s original preeminent industry:
Aerospace. Today, if you know where to look, you can still see the
once-secluded [Lockheed-Martin](https://goo.gl/maps/sX3J8D7q2422
"Map") aerospace complex through the trees from one of the many
tourist attractions that grew up around it.
