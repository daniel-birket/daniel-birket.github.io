![Head Shot](Daniel-Birket-Head.jpg)

I am Daniel Birket, a software engineer who has grown gray helping
[Birket Engineering](http://www.birket.com) to create control systems
for safety-related applications for theme-park attractions and
entertainment venues world-wide. If you have visited a few popular
theme-parks and rode their rides, there is an excellent chance that one
of our control systems helped to ensure your safety.

I, my wife and three grown children live and work in central
Florida, USA, near the popular Disney World and Universal Studios
theme parks. Before I joined the world’s small community of theme-park
engineers, I, like my father, worked in Central Florida’s original
preeminent industry: Aerospace. Today, if you know where to look, you
can still see the once-secret Lockheed-Martin complex through the
trees from the top of a water slide at one of the many tourist
attractions clustered around it.
