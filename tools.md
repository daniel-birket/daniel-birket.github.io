This is a list of open-source tools that I have used and recommend to
“power users” of Windows or MacOS: savy non-programmers that may have
never used a command-line-interface or assume that
“[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)” and
“[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel)” are
misspellings.

If you feel limited by the glitzy facade of your consumer-oriented
graphical human-machine interface and like [Mr. Thomas A.
Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix) "Neo"), feel
that there must be something more - a deeper reality - then I invite
you choose the [red
pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill) and start
your journey beyond the curtain of your desktop screen. Your journey
of enlightenment will be challenging and require much study and
practice, but once you have experienced reality, you won’t be
satisfied with what you once knew.
